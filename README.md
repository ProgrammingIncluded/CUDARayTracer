# Ray Tracer w/CUDA and OpenGL #
A simple ray tracer project for Linear Algebra class.
Inspired and based off of online Ray Tracing examples/tutorials.

## Required Libraries ##
* SFML 2.1
* CUDA
* OpenGL

## Things to Note ##
This project is not meant to revolutionize the ray tracer.
The linear algebra technique used in this project may be slower than libraries that one might find. Due to this project being
used in the linear algebra class, custom linear algebra code is used instead.
